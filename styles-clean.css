/* Vignelli Transit Modernism - Cleaned Stylesheet */
/* This is the cleaned version - to replace styles.css if needed */

/* ===== VIGNELLI TRANSIT DESIGN SYSTEM ===== */
/* Following Vignelli Transit Modernism principles per style guide:

   TYPOGRAPHY (Ultra-Legible):
   - Frutiger/Univers priority (designed for signage/airports)
   - Bold weights only (700) - no light/medium confusion
   - High contrast (black on white, white on color)
   - Generous sizing (legible at distance)
   - Mixed case (more readable than ALL CAPS)
   
   COLOR CODING (Systematic):
   - Functional route colors: Red #E22726, Blue #0078D7, Green #00A65E
   - Orange #F57F29, Purple #7B2D8E
   - Colorblind-friendly, high contrast
   - Consistent meanings (Red line = red everywhere)
   
   PICTOGRAMS (Universal Language):
   - Simple geometric silhouettes (■ ◯ △ □ ◇ ●)
   - Universal meaning (transcends language)
   - Scale: 50-100mm print / 100-200px digital
   
   INFORMATION HIERARCHY:
   - Destination/line name LARGEST (72px hero, 48px secondary)
   - Direction arrows bold and clear
   - Left-aligned text (easy scanning)
   - Top-down hierarchy (important info at top)
   
   SYSTEMATIC CONSISTENCY:
   - Mathematical 8px grid system
   - Same rules applied everywhere
   - User-centered (designed for hurried, confused users)
   - Timeless aesthetic (decades-long lifespan)

/* This would be the basis for a completely cleaned stylesheet */
