Grounded in Swiss Modernist principles and shaped by the work of Italian architect Massimo Vignelli, this style focuses on clarity, structure, and consistency. It is widely used in transit and signage systems — airports, train stations, and subways — where wayfinding must be immediate and dependable. By organizing complex networks and maintaining a unified visual language, it helps people navigate unfamiliar places with clarity and confidence. The result is a design approach that remains practical, reliable, and timeless.
