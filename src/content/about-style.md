### **1. Clarity Above All**
- Information must be readable at a distance.
- Accuracy is less important than usability.

### **2. Typography**
- Humanist sans-serifs (Frutiger, Univers).
- High contrast, large sizes, mixed case for shape recognition.

### **3. Color Systems**
- Colors represent routes, zones, or meaning.
- Not used decoratively.

### **4. Pictograms**
- Universal silhouettes inspired by Otl Aicher.
- Simple geometry, consistent weight, minimal detail.

### **5. Diagrammatic Maps**
- Schematic, not literal, emphasizes connections and routes.
- 45° and 90° line angles.

### **6. System Thinking**
- Every part fits into a larger grid.
- Information hierarchy is strict and predictable.

Transit Modernism treats public information like architecture — structured, logical, and universal.
